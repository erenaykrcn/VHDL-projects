This is a project that implements a sequential multiplier circuit, based
on a Moore Finite State Machine. Its controller is implemented with a 
ROM based lookup table. A combinational approach for the controller can be 
found in my other projects.
Its worst case runtime is 20 clk periods. Clk period is set to 10ns as
an example.
